config SDK_MPY_HOOK_UART_STDOUT_MUTUAL_ACCESS_ENABLE
    bool "enable mutual access hook of micropython uart stdout"
    default y
    help
        enables a hook functions supporting a mutual access on the uart instance
        responsible for serial communication for stdout (logs).
        This hook is applied by a patch to "micropython/ports/esp32/uart.c"

config SDK_MPY_HOOK_MACHINE_I2C_INIT_ENABLE
    bool "enable a micropython machine_i2c_init hook"
    default y
    help
        enables a hook function over the micropython machine_i2c initialization.
        this is required for io-expander to organize the mutual working of the
        I2C instance that is used by the io-expander and any other device using
        the micropython interface and the same I2C instance.
